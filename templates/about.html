            Ayurvedic herbs are thought to be the unearthly embodiment of plants in the ancient Indian science of Ayurveda. Plants capture sunlight-based vitality, i.e. via photosynthesis, and convert it into vitamins that animals can digest. These ayurvedic herbs can be consumed or applied extrinsically through a variety of healing techniques. Theyâ€™re thought to protect your body from illness and provide a variety of medical benefits, such as better physical and emotional health. Hence, it is important to include ayurvedic herbs for immunity and health.
